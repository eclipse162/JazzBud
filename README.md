# JazzBud 

**Jazzbud** is a web application for sharing jazz music solos and jazz artist ratings.

This app allows users to **partition jazz songs from Spotify** based off musical segments (ie. Intro, Head, Solo).

In the future, this app will Allow users to share their own partitioning of jazz tracks and see other users' list of artist solos, with their respective lengths and ratings.

Rough Roadmap
------

##### Phase 1
The goal with this phase is to create a client-side application that supports the following:

- Users can input Spotify track
- The application scrapes track length and allows users to partition track
- User can see their own track partitioning when the track is playing
- User can see which partition they are at when the song is playing
- User can export and import track partitions
- User can save and load track partitions

##### Phase 2
- Users can upload their track partitions to a server-side database
- Users can access other user’s track partitions and play them
- Users can make accounts and see which partitions they’ve saved, favorited


##### Phase 3
- Artist pages track which tracks they solo in
- Solos are listed by length
- Users can rate and favorite solos
